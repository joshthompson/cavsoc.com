		<p>On the surface, CAVSOC are a creative agency and production company creating beautiful video and photography content for a range of clients across a range of sectors, from fashion labels and music artists to tech start-ups and multinational corporates.</p>
		<p>At its heart, though, CAVSOC is a collective of friends who love working together and are passionate about what they do. And we mean real friends, this isn’t the usual corporate spiel of feeling like a family. We grew up and learnt together. We work, play and laugh together, and understand each other, something we’ve always found has given us the edge in an industry that is based on collaborative efforts.</p>
		<p>Having worked client-side, agency-side and freelance, we teamed up to share our expertise and create work we could be proud of on our own terms. We’ve worked for some of the world’s leading brands, blah blah blah…</p>
